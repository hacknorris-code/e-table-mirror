# e-table

hackable fidget table online.

add or delete rows/columns with buttons on sides of table.
single-click to edit content of any cell
middle/right-click to change colors of cell to random

supports extensions by just importing js file :) (docs for api LATER - for now just read source and rev-engineer that, code is quite short tbh)

theme you can toggle at top of page

can be used for:
- making pixel or text-based art
- making site layout or game previews (specially rpg games)
- fighting boredom by randomly clicking on table
- using it instead of excel but without calculations
- possibly inventing local games (tictactoe?)
- and many more ways to use (i just don't know what)
